Idea: A way to log and analyze dreams in a centralized place. A dream journal that helps me track patterns, analyze moods, and categorize my dreams. Anything that supports me in understanding my subconscious thoughts and discovering recurring themes.

Initial User Stories:
- As a user, I want to log my dreams, so I can keep a record of them over time.
- As a user, I want to categorize my dreams by type, so I can analyze common patterns.
- As a user, I want to search through my dream logs, so I can find specific dreams easily.
- As a user, I want to analyze the text of my dreams, so I can identify common themes or recurring words.
- As a user, I want to view dream statistics, so I can better understand my emotional and mental patterns.
- As a user, I want to filter dreams by mood, so I can see trends in how I feel.
- As a user, I want to filter dreams by date, so I can track how my dreams evolve over time.
- As a user, I want to share dreams with friends, so I can discuss them.
